# Genesis-AI
**Problem**

Early-stage founders struggle during the zero-to-one phase.
Validating ideas, building financial models, designing products, and preparing investor-ready materials require fragmented tools, technical expertise, and guesswork.

Most AI tools generate text.
They don’t generate structured execution.

# Solution

Genesis is a multi-agent AI system that transforms raw startup ideas into validated, executable business outputs.

Instead of acting as a chatbot, Genesis reasons, debates, models, and generates real execution artifacts — all within a single intelligent workflow.

 **Core Features**
**AI Boardroom Simulation**

Genesis simulates a multi-agent boardroom where agents (investor, product strategist, technical lead, etc.) challenge assumptions through adversarial reasoning. Ideas must earn consensus before moving to execution.

 **Financial Model Generation**

After validation, Genesis generates a structured 3-year revenue projection using growth and churn modeling. Financial outputs are written directly into Google Sheets for transparency and investor readiness.

**Prototype Generation**

Genesis generates real Flutter (Dart) UI code and renders a visual simulation of the interface — allowing founders to preview their product before development.
